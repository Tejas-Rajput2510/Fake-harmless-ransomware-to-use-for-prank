In this repositry, there is a script named "Ransomware.py". This is a script which is a fake ransomware which is totally harmless, and used for prank purposes. Don't use it on wrong places. So, in this README, we will talk about it and how to use it. If you are still thinking its harmful, you can check out the code and verify it.

**How to use it?**
To use it, follow the instructions below:
1. Make sure you have python installed on your PC.
2. Download and open the "Ransomware.py" file.
Now, you will see a window "Terms and conditions". Bassically, its a fake window representing fake terms and conditions. if you press accept button, the fake virus will start. But if you do not accept them, the whole script will close. Its also totally fake which you can check by viewing the code of the python file. Then, a red window will appear infront of you saying that your files are encrypted, but it's fake. I am reminding you again that you can check it by viewing the code of the script. And also, there will be a key enter field where you have to enter your key to exit the prank, and the key is: Lol!Youwereprankedverybadly@hahahaha!
When you enter this key, the screen will turn green saying that your files are restored, and then after 5 seconds, the script will auto exit. And also in the script, when the ransomware has started, you will also get other text stuff and a 1 hour timer. You might think that after the one hour has done, it will show that files are deleted, but instead, when it reaches 00:00, it will just stuck their because it is fake ransomware.
Now, there is also another way to exit this prank without entering the correct key. And the way is, exit it via task manager. Quick, easy and effective.

Make sure you use this prank for prank purposes only. Be mindful about how and where you use this. I am reminding you again that you can check the whole script by checking the code.
